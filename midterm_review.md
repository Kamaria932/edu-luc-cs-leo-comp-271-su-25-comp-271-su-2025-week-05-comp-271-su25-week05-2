## Midterm Reflection

I feel good about my academic, personal, and overall performance in comp 271 course thus far. I felt a little uneasy the first three weeks of this course and maybe assignments 1 and 2. I asked the professor to review magic numbers, during class, because I felt that I was adding it in my orginial homework assignment 1 code. Prof. Leo spent around 10 minutes explaining what it meant and going over example problems. In my previous classes we just called it random numbers that made no sense to the reader, and that is exaclty what Leo meant by a magic number just different wording. I felt uneasy about meeting all the coding requirements at the beginning and made sure I did not repeat a mistake which I think it's safe to say I haven't. All of my problems were new and not repeated. 

I have one assignment that was updated at least one hour after the 5pm deadline. Therefore, this mistake was updating code after the deadline. The soultions were not posted yet, and I only added a reflection the code was complete. Although I do know about the strict deadline policies my code was done before the 5 pm mark and everything was succefully submitted before the solutions were posted. That week I struggled a lot with finding time to finish the homework. I have never missed an assignment, turned in incomplete work, or lack of java code and/or comments.

The first three weeks I was early or on time. The last three weeks I was around 2-4 minutes late to the meetings. I am not a morning person and although 10 is not too early my summer schedule does not help. It is not every three days of the week but maybe at least once and no more than twice for two consecutive weeks. I plan on joining early and having my camera off until the meeting starts, so I can wrap up anything I need to do in the morning and make sure I join class on time. My attendace is good I believe I missed two meetings and one was medical related, and the other I was kicked out the meeting for my camera not working, but I talked to prof. Leo and quickly had that resolved and noted to contact before the meeting to avoid being kicked out. No problems after that though. Participation is going well. I ask questions and send emails + I answer when called on. I learned more on magic numbers, mark down, and more on github. These were all questions I asked on to make sure I turned in the homework on time. My commitment to this course is a good amount. I spend around 11+ hours reviewing materials, writing notes, checking my email, completing assignments, and going over weekly summaries.
