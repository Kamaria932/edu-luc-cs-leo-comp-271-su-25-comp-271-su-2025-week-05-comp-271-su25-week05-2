## Reflection on Week-04 Assignment 

**What went well:**
factoring out the this.tail = node so it only appears once, maintaining backwards links, and avoiding repetitve logic - keeping my code simple and clear. I can see some lines of code that matches the professor's logic and thinking. My code compiles and the programmer's pact was compliant as well.

**Improvements:**
I could have worked more on my compare to logic using Integer.compare or something along those lines. Adding a private int size and setting it to zero. Additionally, increment and decrement in other methods to reflect that Maybe null checks for overload safety. I think some methods are simple and neat while other methods look length, complicatied, and repeitive.


**Grade:**
I would give me a B-. This week I felt like the logic was on the right track and the logic was mostly simple and beginner friendly. It was evident it was not excellent work with more than a few improvements but enough to do what the read me prompts asks with making sure there are no errors and the methods were understandable.
